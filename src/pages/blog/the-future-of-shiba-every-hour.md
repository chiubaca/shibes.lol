Firstly, big thanks to everyone that that has been contributing to shibes.lol over the last couple of weeks.

We have nearly **900** community shibas submitted. These shiba pics are now being used to power [@ShibaEveryHour](https://twitter.com/ShibaEveryHour) üéâ.

Y'all have saved this account and I am eternally grateful üôè.

For those of you that missed the drama. For past five years, ShibaEveryHour was powered by a [third party shiba image service](https://web.archive.org/web/20240330190529/https://shibe.online/) which was not under my control. That service went down on the 25th May. I thought that this would be the end of this little project, but I did'nt want it to be!

I&#39;ve reached out to the owner and not getting any response back. I&#39;m fearful it might be down for goodüò¢ 1/? üßµ</p>&mdash; chiubaca (@chiubaca) <a href="https://twitter.com/chiubaca/status/1795816063835541854?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote>

I debated building my own shiba image crawler. This would have been a big effort so I decided to build shibes.lol as a first pass to see _if_ a community effort could be viable . I wasn't expecting to see **hundreds** of contributions within the first hours of launching!

The success of shibe.lol is amazing. It guarantee the future of this little bot to bring you hourly shibes for many more years to come!‚ú®

So what's next? 

Firstly I'm building more shiba bots! If you dont want to stick around on X (Twitter). You can find ShibaEveryHour on [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@ShibaEveryHour) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/shibaeveryhour.bsky.social). If you want see shibas on more platforms, reach out to me on [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/chiubaca)!


When I have time I also plan to expose shibes.lol as public API for others to build upon too!

And guess what? All of my work is [open source](https://github.com/chiubaca/shiba-every-hour).

There's so much more I want to do, so watch this space. 

I'm doing this all in my spare time for fun. But if you want to support me, consider dropping me a donation on [kofi](https://ko-fi.com/chiubaca) ‚òïÔ∏è .
